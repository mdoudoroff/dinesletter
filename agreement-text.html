<h2>Subscription Agreement</h2>

<p>This constitutes the On Line Subscription Agreement (“Agreement”) between you and James Dines &amp; Company Inc. (“JD&amp;C”), the publisher of The Dines Letter™ (“TDL”) and the Interim Warning Bulletin (“IWB”). The terms “TDL” and, if subscribed for, the “IWB”, as they are used in this Agreement include any wireless device optimized version of The Dines Letter or Interim Warning Bulletin, or electronic versions of The Dines Letter or Interim Warning Bulletin. In this Agreement, “you” and “your” refer to each licensed subscriber of TDL and the IWB, whose subscription is in effect. This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions for your use of TDL, IWB and the associated e-mail services provided by JD&amp;C as a part of your subscription. Your electronic access to TDL, IWB and/or other e-mail services of JD&amp;C (“Subscription-Based Services”) constitutes your agreement to the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p>1. Your Rights: JD&amp;C grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited right and license to access, use and display TDL and the IWB (if subscribed for) and the materials provided thereon, and to download or print content displayed in TDL and the IWB, provided you comply fully with and observe the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The contents of TDL and the IWB are only for your personal, noncommercial use and shall not be forwarded to others. Failure to comply with this provision may at JD&amp;C's option result in immediate suspension or termination of your right to receive your subscription-based services forever.</p>
<p>2. Subscription: In order to provide you with uninterrupted service, the online Subscription-Based Services, specifically TDL and IWB, when purchased online, will renew automatically at the end of the applicable subscription period at the rate then in effect. We shall alert you at the point of offer when a subscription product is offered on an auto-renewing basis. As explained below, JD&amp;C will automatically charge your payment card for an auto-renewing subscription unless you cancel continuation of your subscription before the end of your subscription by electronic or written notice to JD&amp;C. Subscribers will be sent a reminder notice before the expiration of your subscription term that alerts you to the upcoming subscription renewal charge.</p>
<p>3. Payment: You agree to pay, using a valid payment card which JD&amp;C accepts, all fees and charges, including applicable taxes, you have incurred through your account, including subscription charges to receive TDL and/or IWB. JD&amp;C reserves the right to increase fees and surcharges, including fees for TDL and IWB, or to institute new fees at any time, upon notice posted in advance or sent to you based on the contact information you provide.</p>
<p>4. Cancellation of Automatic Renewal: Unless you take action to cancel your auto-renewing TDL and IWB subscriptions through the method described above, JD&amp;C will automatically charge your payment card listed in your account to renew your TDL and, if applicable, IWB subscriptions. Before your payment card is charged JD&amp;C will send you a reminder of the renewal, which will contain the applicable subscription rate, to the address you provided for your account. In the event JD&amp;C cannot charge the payment card listed in your account, we reserve the right to terminate your access to TDL and IWB subscription.</p>
<p>5. Billing: For purposes of identification and billing, you agree to provide JD&amp;C with accurate, complete, and updated information required when purchasing a product or service online, including registering for the subscription-based TDL and IWB services (“Registration Data”). Registration Data might include your name, address, telephone numbers, email address and applicable current payment card data (e.g., payment card type, number and expiration date). You might update your Registration Data at any time by e-mail or written notice to JD&amp;C. Failure to comply with this provision (including without limitation falsification of any Registration Data) may, at JD&amp;C’s option, result in immediate suspension or termination of your right to receive Subscription-Based Services.</p>
<p>6. Copyright and Trademarks: All materials available in TDL and IWB, including without limitation text, data, images, audio and video clips, databases, (collectively, the “Content”) are owned or controlled by JD&amp;C or the party credited as the provider of the Content. The respective owner retains all right, title, and interest in and to its Content.

As such you agree not to distribute or circulate TDL or IWB or any material contained therein by any means including without limitation, e-mail, photocopy, fax, to any individuals or entities.</p>
<p>7. Miscellaneous: This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California and shall not be amended except by a writing signed by a duly authorized officer of JD&amp;C, and shall be binding on you and your legal representatives. You agree to be bound by the restrictions, limitations and disclaimers contained in each issue of tdl and iwb, as they may appear from time to time which are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth at length in this agreement.
