	GoldBug</h2>



<p class="buttonheading">

<h3 class="sh">"Is it too late, to buy gold and silver at these prices? It's never too late to buy gold and silver, to be held until the end of the fiat money era."</h3>
<p class="tab" style="text-align:center"><strong>From <em>Goldbug!</em>-The final and definitive  work on gold investing by Mr James Dines</strong></p>
<p>  </p>
<p class="tab"><em> Goldbug!</em> is intended to be the final word on investing in gold and its role in government  from Mr James Dines, "The Original Goldbug" and internationally known gold  expert. Mr Dines, was the first Security Analyst on Wall Street to recommend  gold at $35 an ounce at a time when the President of the United States and Under  Secretary of the Treasury, Paul Volcker, swore that they would "never" allow the  price of gold to rise. Since then, gold has risen over 3,000% to a high of  $1,218.25 on December 3, 2009- a record-setting level that has made a fortune  for some shrewd investors.</p>
<p><span class="tab">After Mr Dines was fired from his Wall Street job for recommending gold, he  began to publish <em>The Dines Letter</em> (TDL) independently and defiantly  became known as "The Original Goldbug." </span> <span class="tab">Indeed, in the last decade, gold has risen every single year. It's a performance  that's been matched by no other asset. In addition, Mr Dines predicts much  higher gold prices ahead, for the reasons carefully delineated in his brand-new  book, <em>Goldbug!</em></span></p>
<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>Goldbug!</em> not only provides unique insight into gold investing that only Mr Dines can  provide, it also offers historical perspective and little-known details.</p>
<p class="tab">For instance, it's a virtually unknown and startling fact that gold stocks also  soared during the 1929 Crash (from 1928 to 1937), indicating similar causes  behind the economic plunges of 1929 and 2008.</p>
<p class="tab">Those who boasted of having studied the 1930s in order to guarantee such a  Depression would never happen again are in effect studying the symptoms rather  than the true cause, a classic case of falsely concluding that wet sidewalks  cause rain!</p>
<p class="tab">The book will give you insight to the past, present and future of  precious-metals holdings and the state of world governments. Mr Dines' accurate  predictions are uncanny. Here is a sampling of what you will find in <em>Goldbug!</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Many  naturally think of the "price of gold," whereas the counterintuitive truth is  the other way around. Gold is the real money, and it commands different  quantities of paper in various countries."</li>
<br>
<li>"Inflation is not the same as rising prices<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Symbol">. </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Checking the dictionary reveals that  inflation is "an increase in the supply of money and credit," the result of  which is often -- but not always -- higher prices."</span></li>
<br>
<li>"Periods of inflation are invariably followed by  deflationary corrections, albeit sometimes interrupted by a hyperinflation,  which Mr Dines baptized "The Supernova of Inflations."</li>
<br>
<li>"There must be an approximately equal connection  between creating paper money and the true wealth created by work and services  enshrined by our Founding Fathers in the gold and silver clause in our  Constitution." </li>
<br>
<li><em><strong>The Dines Letter (TDL)</strong></em><strong> </strong> originated the phrase "Silver is the poor man's gold" and later came up with the  phrases "Platinum is the rich man's gold" and "Palladium is the poor man's  platinum."</li>
<br>
<li>Nobody  could stop what TDL calls political Taxpigs at the trough. The key to stopping  them cold is linking paper money to gold."</li>
<br>
<li>"Every nation in the world is recklessly  printing money, in varying quantities, at their whimsical choosing, and nearly  everybody accepts this as natural. If a government could really create  prosperity by printing more money and creating credit, why not double the money  supply every day and give everybody a million dollars?" </li>
<br>
<li>It's  one of the shocking predictions in <em>Goldbug!</em> that 1980 was actually the  onset of a deflation that has yet to run its course. America is still slipping  toward "The Coming Great Deflation" compared to the ongoing one that began in  America in 1980, and for Japan starting in 1989." </li>
<br>
<li>"Bubbles are invisible to those inside the  bubbles."</li>
<br>
<li>Nations  have been cutting their interest rates so much that their currencies have become  less attractive to income-seeking investors and thus have declined, which aided  their exporters and inhibited imports! Competing currency devaluations are what  Mr Dines calls a "fool's race to the bottom" because, sooner or later, interest  rates would be at zero, could go no lower, and then what?"</li>
<br>
<li>"The disintegration of the international  monetary system as we know it lies somewhere just ahead." </li>
<br>
<li>"Fiat money is paper currency not convertible  into coin or equivalent value." </li>
<br>
<li>By  1600, a strong business-minded state as a natural partner of a political state  was known as Mercantilism, which in those days gained silver and gold by  emphasizing exports over imports."</li>
<br>
<li>"All a gold standard does is simply force a  government to give to the world as much as it takes in, using gold as an  international common denominator for all currencies. America could not have run  up its sky-high debts if the dollar had been linked to gold." </li>
<br>
<li>At the little-noticed Genoa Conference starting on April 10, 1922, the politicians  slipped a profound change into the law by changing "the gold standard" into what  they called "the gold-exchange standard." Politicians decided to count gold  twice (the gold itself and also the gold-backed currency). That doubled the  money supply. (The fallacy is that the gold-exchange standard counted the gold  twice-once where it was stored, and again in any country that held paper dollars  or pounds backed by gold.) The unleashing of that much cash in 1922 was the true  cause of the subsequent boom into 1929. It was an inflation that was punished by  the subsequent deflation of the early 1930s. Believe it or not, this is a  position almost totally disbelieved to this very day, and you won't even readily  locate that 1922 Conference in current history books, much less in the press!"</li>
<br>
<li>"These days the Fed resists an audit on the  grounds it would make its decisions controllable by politicians, which it  already is anyway."</li>
<br>
<li>"Gold is the fulcrum, the very central lever  within the deepest inner recesses of capitalism itself. Touch the golden lever,  and its effects are so profound that they could surface many years later. Gold  is the very pituitary gland of our economic organism."</li>
<br>
<li>History  never reveals its alternatives." </li>
<br>
<li>"Inflation is cumulative and exponential."</li>
<br>
<li>On  December 17, 2008, a front-page headline in <em>The New York Times</em> proclaimed, "In a Bold Action, Fed Cuts Key Rate to Virtually Zero: Plans to  Print as Much Money as Needed to Ease the Frozen Credit Markets." In other  words, to cure an indigestible excess of fiat money, they'll print more, except  now "as much as needed," without apparent limit!" <br><br> "Our economic leaders know not what they do. The predictable punishment will be  a historic deflation, perhaps interrupted by a horrifying hyperinflation  featuring runaway price rises, depending on upcoming political decisions."</li>
<br>
<li>"Gold through the centuries has proved to be  unsurpassed as a standard of measurement, a medium of exchange and a store of  value." </li>
<br>
<li>Inflation  is not the cure for deflation." </li>
<br>
<li>"The very function of a Depression is to return  money to its rightful owners. And who are those rightful owners? Those who wind  up with the money!"</li>
<br>
<li>"How about a flat tax of 10% for everybody, but  as the only tax for all levels of government, letting them fight it out? But  with absolutely no tax deductions for anybody!"</li>
<br>
<li>"As "The Original Silverbug," Mr Dines considers  this metallic element to be the single most underpriced metal on the planet and  headed for sky-high prices."</li>
<br>
<li>"The Coming Currency Upheavals" and "The Coming  Gold Crisis" are yet ahead." </li>
<br>
<li>"Soviet archives confirmed that Harry Dexter  White was indeed spying for the Soviet Union while he was a primary participant  in the Bretton Woods conference, the formation of the International Monetary  Fund and the World Bank, according to Encyclopedia Wikipedia." </li>
<br>
<li>"Too few are aware that the BIS (Bank for  International Settlements) is the central banker's banker for all the national  central banks in the world. Some banks own the banks that control America's  interest rates that in turn control the economy and the stock market. At the top  of the pyramid is the Orwellian BIS (Bank for International Settlements) in  Basel, Switzerland, which some currency conspiracists assert control the center  of the economic world, and nobody knows exactly who owns it. The BIS describes  itself as "central bank for central bankers," yet it shuns publicity. This bank  in Basel has the most incredible powers, including inviolability of all papers  and documents, immunity from jurisdiction and arrest, the right to use codes in  official communications and to receive or send documents by couriers or  diplomatic bags. It's not open to the public, protected by armed guards, and  somebody ought to call for an audit of the BIS as well." </li>
<br>
<li>China  will probably eventually buy every ounce of gold (also silver, platinum,  palladium and Rhodium) it could cart off, sending precious metals prices to the  stratosphere. Without a doubt, when the price of gold bursts higher, it will  help save those who had held precious metals and their mining stocks. The  political ramifications are profound."</li>
<br>
<li>"There is a new geopolitical system coming."</li>
<br>
<li>Our longstanding prediction of "The Coming Great  Deflation," (an echo of what we baptized "The <strong>First</strong> Great Depression")  will cause in this 21st century what we named several decades ago "The Second  Great Depression." <br> <br> Preparations must be made without delay. An inflation can be ruled out because  at this late stage, a deflation is a near certainty. The only remaining question  is whether there will be an intervening hyperinflation. <br><br> This is Mr Dines' final book on gold and is expected to be widely read and  discussed in the highest investment and government circles.</li>
